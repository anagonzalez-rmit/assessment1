                    <p>I am really interested in Web Development and e-commerce development in particular. The topics that interest me the most are: Woocommerce and Shopify Theme & plugin development, and e-commerce app development. </p>

                    <h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
                    <p>Since I was in high school, I wanted to become a Web Developer. However, when I finished school, the only degree option available back in 2006, was Systems Engenieering and I didn't feel confident to do it. Two years ago I decided that it was about time and enrolled in the Diploma of Website Development. </p>

                    <p>I was interested in IT since a very young age because I saw the potential and understood the power of having access to the internet and all you could do with it. But it wasn't until my daughter was born that I felt that I had to pursue my dream of becoming a Developer.</p>

However, I expected to learn programming in depth, but that wasn't part of the program. In my degree I expect to learn a mix of both theory and hands on practical projectcs including web and app development and object oriented programming. </p>

            <p class="mb-4">According to 16 Personalities, “mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.” (16 Personalities, nd) I believe that this test was really accurate and I realised that I have some characteristics that I didn’t know that I had like:

              <li><strong>Passionate and Energetic</strong> which is fundamental to pursue projects and jobs</li>
              <li>And to be <strong>Dedicated and Hard-Working</strong> that is great to have when you are part of a team as it will help to achieve goals. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I believe that my role in a team environment is always as a mediator trying to disipate conflict and avoid arguments. I'm usually not a leader, but I normally work closely with the other team members.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">I took the Big Five Personalities Test and I scored high in the Openness categories which represents a tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. According to Truity those who score high in this category are usually creative, intellectual and enjoy adventure.</p>
            <p>On the negative side I scored high in Neuroticism which means that I can experience negative emotions like fear, anxiety, etc. When working in as part of a team that characteristic could be an issue because I tend to take critisism personally and react negatively by feeling axiety or sadness.</p>

            <p>The project consists of creating a web & mobile app called Gluten Free Eating, where users that follow a gluten free diet can find several kinds of recipes and cooking advice in one place. The ultimate goal is to provide recipes and cooking tips to people with coeliac disease, gluten intolerance or to those whom decided to follow a gluten free diet by choice including vegan, vegetarian or dairy free options. 
            </p>
            <p>Readers would be able to create an account, read and submit recipes, get nutritional information about each dish and even search filtering by ingredients in case they have allergies.

              <h3 class="sub-title mb-4 d-block>Overview">Motivation</h3>
              <p>Four years ago, I was advised to start a gluten free diet to help me treat my thyroid condition. The instructions were to avoid all gluten containing foods such as wheat, oats, barley, rye. From that very moment I started to look for gluten free versions of all my favourite foods and found that to be a really time consuming process. That’s how I came out with my project idea, to help people like me to have a normal lifestyle eating all the foods they like.</p>
              <p>According to Coeliac Australia, 1 in 70 people living in the country are affected by coeliac disease (Coeliac.org nd). Also in some countries such as Finland the prevalence is as high as 2.4 percent in adults between the ages of 30 to 64 years (Lisa Fitterman, Allergic Living nd). Additionally, the cases of reported and in some cases self-diagnosed non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is found to be anywhere between 1% and 13% of the population (2).</p>

            <p>My project idea consists of creating a web and mobile app called Gluten Free Eating that allows users to find gluten free recipes options to their normal eating choices. This way the app can help  those who suffer from more than one food intolerance like dairy or lactose allergies, for instance.</p>
            <p>Today, there are a large number of readily available gluten free foods, but the options are either not healthy, expensive, or contain allergens, amongst many other cons. Also, some people cannot find a good range of ready to eat food like pastry sheets, pizza or desserts at local  stores and that is a real issue for those with a condition such as coeliac disease or gluten allergies.</p>
            <p>The user would be able to find many recipe options and filter by ingredients, dishes or meals and also by dietary choices such as vegetarian, vegan, kosher, paleo etc. If the client creates an account it would allow them to save a recipe for later use, add new preparations, follow recipe authors or comment and rate dishes.</p>
            <p>There will be categories so the reader can search for menu ideas by selecting a meal type such as breakfast, dinner etc. Alternatively, the reader would be able to filter by Dish type: dessert, salad, soup, etc. or by Ingredient such as chocolate, banana, or chicken. Additional filters would be added to exclude ingredients or common allergens such as soy, dairy, egg, nuts or shellfish.</p>
            <p>Each user will have a profile where they could save their dietary preferences and that will generate a custom feed where they will be able to find recipes that fit their choices ordered by Popular recipes and Recently added. The user will be able to follow other user profiles, receive notifications when a new recipe is added and also rate each recipe out of 5.</p>
              <p>The recipes will have a list of ingredients (and the ability to create a shopping list), step by step instructions, preparation time, and an ingredient replacement calculator. The replacement calculator is an important tool because the gluten free flours don’t behave in the same way as a wheat flour, and in some cases when doing substitutions it may happen that more liquids are needed or that a flour can be replaced only by a mix of a starch and another flour, for instance.</p>
              <p>As mentioned before, the lack of ready to eat healthy options is a common issue that people with coelic disease face. For that reason, I see the importance of including a nutritional table for each recipe, which can be calculated by analising the list of ingredients.</p>
              <p>To help as many users as possible, Gluten Free Eating will be available to download form the Apple Store as well as Play Store for mobile devices and would be accessible through web browsers as a web app for those who prefer to use it on their computers. The reader will be able to connect their social media profiles to authenticate and to allow them to share their profile as well as recipes with friends and family.</p>

              <h3 class="sub-title mb-4 d-block">Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <p>To create the web app, the technologies that I would use will be PHP, Firebase, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap. It will be necessary to design and build a database to store recipes and user details and I determined that the most suitable option is Firebase. Also, the backend will be developed using PHP doing a completely custom system.</p>
              <p>Also, we’ll need a cloud server to host the web app like Digital Ocean or Amazon Web Services.
              To develop the app, initially an app builder like Thunkable could be used to create a cross-platform mobile application and in the future migrate to native apps. Firebase can be integrated with the apps using Thunkable app builder.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-6 mb-4 mt-4">
              <h3 class="sub-title mb-4 d-block">Skills Required</h3>
              <p> The required skills are: programming & database knowledge, User Interface and user experience, front & backend development, server and hosting configuration, general business knowledge. </p>
              <p>
              I do have some functional programming skills using PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery but I understand that I would need to improve them. Also,I'd need to learn how Firebase works and any applicable APIs to connect the apps with the real time database.</p>
              <p>
              Also, I’ve used Thunkable in the past and I found it to be quite a useful tool but I’m aware of its limitations so I expect to learn Java and Swift in the future to create native mobile applications.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-12 mb-4 mt-4">
              <h3 class="sub-title mb-4 d-block text-center">Outcome</h3>
              <p>I expect the outcome to be really positive amongst people with dietary issues. When I stopped eating wheat and started a gluten free diet, I experienced a significant change in my overall health, but also found huge challenges and issues that I never expected. Reading every single label to check if the product contains hidden ingredients such as barley in a tomato sauce or wheat in a mayonnaise is stressing and time consuming and led me rethink my whole alimentary habits. And that’s why I understand how important is to have access to cooking tips and recipes to be able to enjoy our favourite meals as anybody else and I think that people with special dietary requirements would find the app really useful and practical.</p>
